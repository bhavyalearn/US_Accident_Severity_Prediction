# US_Accident_Severity_Prediction
This project intends to predict the severity of accidents in US

The goal is to predict severity from multiple features given in the dataset. Severity of the accident is a number between 1 and 4, where 1 indicates the least impact on traffic (i.e., short delay as a result of the accident) and 4 indicates a significant impact on traffic (i.e., long delay).

Here is the source of data https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents.
